Feature: Test creating a Combined question
  As a teacher
  In order to test my students in flexible ways
  I need to be able to create a Combined question

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username |
      | teacher  |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname |
      | Course 1 | C1        |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user    | course | role           |
      | teacher | C1     | editingteacher |

  @javascript
  Scenario: Create a Combined question with a full range of sub-parts
    When I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question bank" page logged in as teacher
    And I press "Create a new question ..."
    And I set the field "Combined" to "1"
    And I click on "Add" "button" in the "Choose a question type to add" "dialogue"
    And I should see "Adding a combined question"
    And I set the field "Question name" to "New combined question"
    And I set the field "Question text" to "What is the pH of a 0.1M solution? [[1:numeric:__10__]]<br/>What is the IUPAC name of the molecule? [[2:pmatch:__20__]]<br/>Which elements are shown? [[3:multiresponse]]<br/>Which element is shown as white? [[6:singlechoice]]<br/>When a solution is combined with oil the result is a [[4:selectmenu:2]]<br/>Showworking [[5:showworking:__80x5__]]"
    And I set the field "General feedback" to "The molecule is ethanoic acid which is more commonly known as acetic acid or in dilute solution as vinegar. The constituent elements are carbon (grey), hydrogen (white) and oxygen (red). A 0.1M solution has a pH of 2.88 and when a solution is combined with oil the result is a vinaigrette."
    And I press "Update the form"

    # Follow sub-questions (The order of sub-questions comes from the question text).
    # Numeric part.
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And the field "Answer must match" matches value "match ()"
    And "Help with Model answer" "icon" should exist
    And I click on "Help with Model answer" "icon"
    And I should see "Give one possible answer to this question that would be graded correct."
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | id_subqnumeric1defaultmark     | 20%                                     |
      | id_subqnumeric1answer_0        | 2.88                                    |
      | Scientific notation            | No                                      |
      | id_subqnumeric1generalfeedback | You have the incorrect value for the pH |

    # Pattern-match part.
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | id_subqpmatch2defaultmark          | 20%                                |
      | id_subqpmatch2applydictionarycheck | Do not check spelling of student   |
      | id_subqpmatch2answer_0             | match_mw (ethanoic acid)           |
      | id_subqpmatch2generalfeedback      | You have the incorrect IUPAC name. |
      | id_subqpmatch2modelanswer          | ethanoic acid                      |

    # Multi-response part.
    And I press "Blanks for 3 more choices"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
