  Scenario: Test duplicating a combined question and editing subquestions before saving
    Given the following "questions" exist:
      | questioncategory | qtype    | template  | name               |
      | Test questions   | combined | numerical | Combined numerical |
    When I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question bank" page logged in as teacher
    And I choose "Duplicate" action for "Combined numerical" in the question bank

    And I set the field "Question name" to "The duplicated question"
    And I set the field "Question text" to "What 4.5 + 4.5? [[no1:numeric:__10__]]"
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | id_subqnumericno1defaultmark | 100%                             |
      | id_subqnumericno1answer_0    | 9                                |
      | General feedback             | General feedback: 4.5 + 4.5 = 9. |
      | id_subqnumericno2defaultmark | 50%                              |
    And I press "id_submitbutton"
    And I should see "One or more embedded questions have been removed from the question text"
    And I press "id_submitbutton"

    # Verify that both questions now exist in the question bank.
    Then I should see "Combined numerical"
    And I should see "The duplicated question"

    # Verify the original question still works the way it always did.
    And I am on the "Combined numerical" "core_question > preview" page
    And I set the field "Answer no1" to "6.5"
    And I set the field "Answer no2" to "11"
    And I press "Submit and finish"
    And I should see "Well done!"

    # Check the modified question is as expected.
    And I am on the "The duplicated question" "core_question > preview" page
    And I set the field "Answer no1" to "9"
    And I press "Submit and finish"
    And I should see "Well done!"
